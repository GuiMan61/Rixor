Go [here] [7] for a full tutorial on how to setup Rixor on your own server. 

[PRE] Compiling your own version of ParaPGM (for developers only!)
-------------------------------------------
First things first, you're going to need to download and **install** [Lombok] [6] onto Eclipse or IntelliJ, this is so that the methods work. Make sure you restart Eclipse or IntelliJ after install *cough* *cough*

Next, you're going to need to import the following jars into your project!
- [dom4j Library] [2]
- [Lombok] [6]

After that, export the plugin and you're ready to roll! Just add it to your plugins folder, and follow the setup process below.

**Have fun**
